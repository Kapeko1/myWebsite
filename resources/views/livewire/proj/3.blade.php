@section("Introduction")
    My first large project and first-ever experience with C# and Unity. A real leap into the deep end for a first-year student. I was given a project of another game from this studio, and based on that, I was tasked with creating 'Zgadnij Suchara.' Hours of courses, YouTube videos, StackOverflow, and Unity forums later, I finally succeeded. I submitted the project without the functionality for ads and payment handling, but I was quite satisfied with the final result.

@section("Key features")
    <div>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li><strong>Type of data:</strong> All riddles are stored as GameObjects, each containing two strings - the question and the answer.</li>
            <li><strong>Letters shuffling:</strong> Initially, the game generated 3 rows of letters (a mix of correct and irrelevant ones), but due to the high difficulty level, I limited the letters to only the correct ones - which were still shuffled.</li>
            <li><strong>Saved Scores:</strong> The game stores all user information (gold and points) locally using SharedPreferences.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>@endsection




@section("Additional info")
   <p> The game is available on Android: <a class="hover:cursor-pointer text-blue-400" target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplicity.zgadnijsuchara&hl=pl">GooglePlay</a></p>
<p>I consider the game a co-work because I developed it while having access to another, similar game. Additionally, the mockup and all the graphics were created by someone else.</p>
